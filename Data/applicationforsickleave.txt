Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave for [number of days] days from [start date] to [end date] due to health reasons.

Unfortunately, I am currently suffering from [briefly mention your illness or health issue, e.g., fever, flu, etc.]. I am under medical treatment and am advised by my doctor to take complete rest for the next [number of days] days to recover fully.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will provide a medical certificate from my doctor, if required, to support my leave application.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could approve my request for sick leave. If there is any additional information you need from me, please let me know.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]
